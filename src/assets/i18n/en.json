            {
            "q": "Can I work abroad if I have a 'grey passport' or non-EU citizenship?",
            "a": "Yes. We work with licensed agencies that arrange legal work permits for non-EU citizens. Many of our candidates from Latvia, Estonia, and other post-Soviet countries have already worked successfully in the EU with Monova’s help."

            {
            "q": "What if I speak only one language?",

            "q": "Do I need to pay Monova for finding me a job?",
            "a": "No. Our service is 100% free for candidates. We are paid by employers who need reliable workers. You should never pay anyone for getting a job through Monova."
            },
            {
            "q": "Who will be my actual employer?",
            "a": "You sign the contract directly with a licensed European employer or partner agency. Monova helps you find, apply, and relocate safely — we are your support, not the hiring company."
            },
            {
            "q": "Does Monova provide accommodation?",

            },
            {
            "q": "Is transport from my country included?",

            {
            "q": "Can couples or friends apply together?",
