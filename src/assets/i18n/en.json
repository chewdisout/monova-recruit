            {
            "q": "Do I need a diploma or special education to work abroad?",
            "a": "No. Most positions we offer (factory, warehouse, logistics, seasonal work, cleaning, hotel service, etc.) do not require higher education. What matters most is motivation and reliability."
            },
            {
            "q": "Can I work abroad if I have a 'grey passport' or non-EU citizenship?",
            "a": "Yes. We work with licensed agencies that arrange legal work permits for non-EU citizens. Many of our candidates from Latvia, Estonia, and other post-Soviet countries have already worked successfully in the EU with Monova’s help."
            },
            {
            "q": "What if I speak only one language?",
            "a": "That’s completely fine! Many employers don’t require English or local language skills. Our coordinators speak your language and explain everything clearly — from contract to accommodation."
            },
            {
            "q": "Do I need to pay Monova for finding me a job?",
            "a": "No. Our service is 100% free for candidates. We are paid by employers who need reliable workers. You should never pay anyone for getting a job through Monova."
            },
            {
            "q": "Who will be my actual employer?",
            "a": "You sign the contract directly with a licensed European employer or partner agency. Monova helps you find, apply, and relocate safely — we are your support, not the hiring company."
            },
            {
            "q": "Does Monova provide accommodation?",
            "a": "Most job offers include organized housing or help finding accommodation. The details (price, distance, facilities) are always explained before you decide to travel."
            },
            {
            "q": "Is transport from my country included?",
            "a": "In some cases yes, in others we help you arrange low-cost options or reimburse travel after the first salary. You always receive travel guidance before departure."
            },
            {
            "q": "Can couples or friends apply together?",
            "a": "Yes. We often place couples and groups of friends together, especially in warehouse and production jobs. Just mention this in your application."

            {
            "q": "How long does the process take?",
            "a": "It depends on the country and type of job — usually 3–10 days from registration to job offer, and 1–3 weeks until travel."

            "q": "What support will I get after arrival?",
